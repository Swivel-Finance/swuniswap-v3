# Swuniswap-v3
A Uniswap v3-esque implementation for Swivel's Orderbook.

-----------

# **Introduction:**

Set your upper and lower ranges in /constants and let Swuniswap-v3 run things from there!

(We suggest you place your ranges equally around market rates)

General Strategy Information: https://swivel.substack.com/p/market-making-in-yield-markets

This strategy takes a user defined range and allocates user liquidity across that range, similar to Uniswap v3.

After this initial liquidity allocation, the strategy continuously adjusts prices according to the factors discussed in the article above (Underlying Rates and Theta).

Specifically, the strategy accomplishes this by ensuring orders are only valid for a limited time, and once expired are replaced with newly updated quotes.

--------

## Installation

#### Install/ensure compatable python version
This is a python project, i'm just going to assume you have a python available. If not, do that first.
Scrivel expects at least a Python version of 3.7.3

#### Assure you have pip available
`which pip`. Depending on your system it may be aliased with ...3 so, `which pip3`. If not present install it.

#### Setting up a virtual environment

```
python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
```

https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html

With the env made, activate it.
```
../Scripts/activate.bat
```
Now you can move to installing things...

#### Installing dependencies

Clone this repo, cd into the directory, (activate your virtual env if you have not) then

    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Private key
If you are performing transactions via the Swivel.py Vendor a private key is expected to be available in the environment as `PRIVATE_KEY`.
This used to sign offline, your private key is never exposed or broadcast in any way.

#### Constants
You'll need to modify the constants located in `/constants/__init__.py`:

E.g.
```
# Market
UNDERLYING = "0x5592EC0cfb4dbc12D3aB100b257153436a1f0FEa" # The underlying token address
MATURITY = float(1669957199) # The Swivel market maturity in unix
DECIMALS = float(18) # The decimals of the underlying token
NETWORK_STRING = "rinkeby"

# Position
AMOUNT = float(10000) # The amount of nTokens to use market-making
UPPER_RATE = float(13) # The highest rate at which to quote 
LOWER_RATE = float(9.5) # The lowest rate at which to quote 
NUM_TICKS = int(3) # The number of liquidity ticks to split your amount into (Per side + 1 at market price)
COMPOUND_RATE_LEAN = float(1) # How much your quote should change when Compoundâ€™s rate varies (e.g. 1 = 1:1 change in price) 
EXPIRY_LENGTH = float(60) # How often orders should be refreshed (in seconds) 

PUBLIC_KEY = "0x3f60008Dfd0EfC03F476D9B489D6C5B13B3eBF2C"
```

This is just one example market, it could, of course, be any other active market. USDC, etc... Feel free to make
any constants you want for others obviously.

## Run Swuniswap-v3
A range strategy on Swivel's exchange can then be run by 

    python swuniswap-v3.py

# Todo
Profit.
